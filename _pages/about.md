Hi there! Welcome to my page. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working with Prof. [Dimitrios Argyropoulos](https://people.ucd.ie/dimitrios.argyropoulos) at the School of Biosystems and Food Engineering, University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland. Prior to joining UCD, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Environmental Systems Science at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. My research focuses on interdisciplinary work in precision livestock farming and smart farming.

I have a foundation in mathematics and engineering, having obtained a Bachelor's degree in Information and Computing Science from Minzu University and a Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering from Beihang University, both in China. My interest in nature and the environment developed early in my life, motivating me to apply my knowledge and skills to contribute to sustainability. Under the supervision of Prof. [Tomas Norton](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6LuDd1oAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and co-supervision of Prof. [Jean-Loup Rault](https://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/en/animal-welfare-science/about-us/head) (University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Austria), I completed my Ph.D. in Bioscience Engineering at KU Leuven, Belgium. I am passionate about applying computer vision and artificial intelligence to enhance the sustainability of agriculture while improving animal health and welfare management.

I have always been fascinated by the dynamics of the natural world â€” from animals and plants to soil, oceans, and weather. I am happy to collaborate on projects related to these topics, especially those focused on sustainability.
