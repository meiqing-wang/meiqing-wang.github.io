Hi there! Welcome to my page. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working with Prof. [Mutian Niu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3PurxN8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in the Department of Environmental Systems Science (D-USYS) at ETH Zurich. My research focuses on interdisciplinary work in precision livestock farming and smart farming. I am passionate about applying computer vision and artificial intelligence to improve animal health and welfare management while enhancing the sustainability of agriculture.

I had a foundation in mathematics and engineering, having got a Bachelor's degree in Information and Computing Science from Minzu University and a Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering from Beihang University, both in China. My interest in nature and environment developed early in my life, motivating me to apply my knowledge and skills to contribute to sustainability. Under the supervision of Prof. [Tomas Norton](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6LuDd1oAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and co-supervision of Prof. [Jean-Loup Rault](https://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/en/animal-welfare-science/about-us/head) (University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Austria), I completed my Ph.D. in Bioscience Engineering at KU Leuven, Belgium. My doctoral research focused on developing computer vision-based approaches to monitor pigs and to improvie their health and welfare management. 

I've always been interested in the changes in nature and environment, including animals, plants, soil, oceans, and weather. I'm happy to collaborate on projects related to these topics, especially those focused on improving sustainability. If you're interested in my work, feel free to email me.
