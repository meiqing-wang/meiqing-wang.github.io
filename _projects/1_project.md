Automated physiological and behavioural monitoring can play a major role in assessing the welfare of pigs. Conventional behaviour monitoring through human observers is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Wearable sensors to measure activity and physiological signals also need to be attached to animals, and so are not robust and animal-friendly for long-term monitoring. The aim of this project was to explore new approaches for monitoring of physiological and behavioural parameters of pigs as a means towards improving animal welfare.  More specifically, given the prevailing advantages this project focuses on developing contactless video-based methods to monitor the heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR) and postural behaviour of pigs. The project was devided into 3 sub-objectives:
 
  - to verify whether the physiological parameters and behaviours could be extracted from and monitored based on RGB videos.
  - to develop a tracking algorithm capable of identifying and tracking individual pigs in a group-housed environment.
  - to assess whether physiological parameters can be effectively monitored in group-housed situations.
